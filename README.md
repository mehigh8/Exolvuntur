# Exolvuntur

Short 5 minute story game (can be completed within one sitting thus does not have a pause menu).
In this game you SHOULD read all the notes that are scattered around, the story behind the game tells you what you have to do,
so don't feel bad that you died, the next time you'll know what is coming!

The game was created over the span of 72 hours by our team, which consists of:

- <a href="https://github.com/PxGluz">Popa Bogdan-Gabriel</a> (who made most of the art)
- <a href="https://github.com/mehigh8">Rosu Mihai Cosmin</a> (who did most of the programming but also worked on some sound editing)
- <a href="https://carol03x.itch.io/">Cozma-Ivan Carol</a> (who did the amazing lighting and created the sound effects and some of the art)
